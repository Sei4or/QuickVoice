# QuickVoice

QuickVoice allows QuickChats to be played to your ears straight from the chat!

# Usage

After installing the plugin it should be instantly ready to use. Some settings can be changed in the BakkesMod GUI (press f2 then go to the plugins tab and click QuickVoice). In the plugin settings, the plugin can be enabled or disabled, preload sounds for quicker playback, or increase/decrease voice volume.
